Technology Stack
Programming Language: JavaScript/TypeScript (recommended)
Web Framework: Express.js
Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose as ODM)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Deployment: Platforms like Heroku, Vercel
Backend Features
Authentication

JWT-based authentication for secure access.
Role-based access control for Admin, Trainer, and Trainee.
Admin Features

Trainer Management: Add, update, delete, and fetch trainers.
Class Scheduling:
Fetch existing schedules.
Add new schedules (max 5 per day, 2-hour duration each).
Assign trainers to classes.
Enforce trainee booking limits (max 10 per class).
Trainer Features

View assigned class schedules with details (date, time, attendees).
Trainee Features

Manage profiles.
Book class schedules (subject to availability).
Error Handling

Unauthorized access (e.g., attempting actions without appropriate permissions).
Validation errors (e.g., incorrect email format).
Booking or scheduling limits exceeded.
Database Schema
User Collection
Fields: id, email, password, role (admin, trainer, trainee), name
Class Collection
Fields: id, trainerId, date, startTime, endTime, trainees[]
Trainer Collection

Business Rules
A maximum of 5 class schedules per day.
Each class has a 2-hour duration.
Max 10 trainees per class schedule.
Admins cannot manage trainee profiles.
API Endpoints

# Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System

## Project Overview

The Gym Class Scheduling and Membership Management System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage gym operations. The system includes role-based access for Admins, Trainers, and Trainees to handle tasks like class scheduling, trainer management, and class bookings.

Admins can manage trainers and class schedules, trainers can view their assigned classes, and trainees can book available classes, all while adhering to business rules such as booking limits and schedule caps.
